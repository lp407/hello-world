I am a Filmmaker and recent graduate, who is learning to programme in C++ as well as working in Unreal engine. I have the goal of becoming an adequate director with a (little) interesting creative portfolio by 09/22. I would like to be able to work freelance and/ or part time, with time to make films as  well.
